# Twenty Questions

A version of the game [Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_questions) that I created while learning Python.

I first created it as I was learning coding through Python for the first time back in 2019. The initial version used no helper functions and tons of nested if loops. As I learned more about programming, I realized that, shockingly, that was not a good idea. So, this is not that initial version.

Note that there are currently very few items that the game knows about and can ask about, and few questions the game will ask.

The game is played by running twenty_questions.py. The file modify_json.py is what I use to add items for the player to guess and questions the game can ask about.
